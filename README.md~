# catalog_analysis
This is an interface to a suite of applications that take in a path to a rockstar simulation and creates a DeltaSigma signal from them.

The algorithm will look like the following:

1) The user supplies a path to a rockstar simulation output.

2) Scan the halo file and determine minimum halo mass (200 particles).

3) Create halo subcatalogs that are binned in mass ranges.

4) Jackknife the halo subcatalogs.

5) Use TreeCorr on the jackknife regions to calculate correlation and cross-correlations. Resum these to get full 3D correlation functions.

6) Run the DeltaSigmaBuilder to create DeltaSigma curves for each leave-one-out JK realization. Resum these to get full DeltaSigma curves.
